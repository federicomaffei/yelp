My-Yelp
====================

Yelp is the Week 8 project I worked on at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).
This application's purpose is being a clone of Yelp, a restaurant listing and rating service. This has been our introduction to Rails, focusing especially on:

* Creating Rails applications
* The structure of Rails apps (models, views, controllers, the router, helpers)
* TDD on Rails, with RSpec & Capybara
* Associations in Rails
* Validations
* AJAX in Rails

====================

The project has been developed through 4 versions:

	1. MVP - For the initial version the core functionality of Yelp has been duplicated - users are presented with a list of restaurants which they can leave reviews for. The features developed via TDD in this iteration are:
		- Visitors can create new restaurants using a form, specifying a name and cuisine.
		- Restaurants can be edited and deleted.
		- Visitors can leave reviews for restaurants, providing a numerical score (1-5) and a comment about their experience.
		- The restaurants listings page should display all the reviews, along with the average rating of each restaurant.
		- Restaurants must be given a name and cuisine, reviews must be given a rating from 1-5 (comment is optional).

	2. Version 2 - adding user login via [Devise](https://github.com/makersacademy/Walkthroughs/blob/master/devise.md). The features developed via TDD in this iteration are:
		- Users can register/login
		- A user must be logged in to create restaurants.
		- Users can only edit/delete restaurants which they've created.
		- Users can only leave one review per restaurant.
		- Users can delete their own reviews.
		- Some indication should be given on the page (as part of the layout) whether the user is currently logged in, along with links to the available actions.
		- The email address of the reviewer should be displayed as part of the review.
		- Users can't review a restaurant which they created.

	3. Version 3 - Enhanced UX with Rails helper methods and AJAX.
